description: Branding â€” Intake & Discovery (capture context from free-form input)
---

Collect all free-form inputs and transform them into a structured brief.

## Steps
1) Capture raw inputs
   - Mission, vision, values, tone, ICPs, competitors, inspirations
   - Constraints (legal, markets, accessibility levels, locales)
   - Success criteria and anti-goals
2) Synthesize into a structured brief
   - Problem statement, outcomes, constraints, risks
   - ICP personas and top jobs-to-be-done
   - Competitive landscape: whitespace, differentiators
3) Log artifacts
   - Save: `project-logs/product/brand-intake-{timestamp}.md`
   - Include links to any external references
4) Gate
   - Confirm scope, timelines, and decision owners

## Tips
- Use examples/screenshots; avoid abstract-only inputs
- Call out unknowns and propose validation steps
